### Signup Page
![New user Signup Page](Images/scm3.jpg)
The signup page allows users to register either through a traditional form or using social logins. We used **HTML and CSS** to design the UI and implemented the backend in **Spring Boot** using **Spring Security**. Users can register using:
- Standard email and password
- Google or GitHub via **OAuth2**

Each registered user is associated with their own set of contacts using **JPA joins**, enabling personalized data storage. Upon signup, user details are stored securely, and their role and verification status are tracked.


### Login/Signup Page
![Signup Page using Google and GitHub](Images/scm2.jpg)
The login page enables users to securely access their accounts using:
- Email and password
- Social logins via **Google** or **GitHub** using **OAuth2**

Weâ€™ve implemented **Spring Security** to manage authentication and protect routes. The login flow ensures only verified and authorized users can access the dashboard and contact data. The UI is responsive and consistent with the overall app design.


### Profile Page
![User Profile Page](Images/scm4.jpg)
The profile page displays personalized information of the logged-in user:
- **Full name**
- **Login method** (Google, GitHub, or standard registration)
- **Email verification status** (highlighted for clarity)

This page is dynamically generated using Thymeleaf and backed by Spring Boot. It retrieves user session data from Spring Security context. This transparency helps users manage their identity and account method in one place.


### User Dashboard
![ User Dashboard Page](Images/scm5.jpg)
The profile page displays personalized information of the logged-in user:
- **Full name**
- **Login method** (Google, GitHub, or standard registration)
- **Email verification status** (highlighted for clarity)

This page is dynamically generated using Thymeleaf and backed by Spring Boot. It retrieves user session data from Spring Security context. This transparency helps users manage their identity and account method in one place.


### Add New Contact Page
![ Adding new contact Page](Images/scm6.jpg)
The add contact page allows users to store detailed information for each contact, including:
- Name, Email, Phone Number
- Description & Profile Image
- Social Media Links (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- Favorite flag (to mark important contacts)

Each contact is linked to the currently authenticated user through **JPA joins**, ensuring data isolation and secure CRUD operations. Image uploads and validation are also supported.


### All User contacts Page 
![View all contacts](Images/scm7.jpg)

### View Contact Details Page
![Contact details](Images/scm8.jpg)
This page shows all saved contacts in the form of cards with quick access to:
- View full details
- Edit or Delete contacts via action icons
- Search contacts by **name, email, or phone**
- Navigate across pages using pagination for large contact lists

The layout is built for responsiveness and ensures users can find and manage their contacts efficiently.


### User Feedback Page
![Feedback Page](Images/scm9.jpg)
User feedback is essential for continuous improvement. The feedback page includes:
- A form to collect suggestions, issues, or general feedback
- Input fields for name, email, and message
- Server-side validation to ensure quality feedback

The submitted data can be reviewed by admins or stored for product enhancement decisions. It reflects the application's user-centric approach.
